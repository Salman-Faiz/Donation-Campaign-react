Cyclones are a threat to the country’s coastal states, particularly Andhra Pradesh, Orissa, and Gujarat. Drought threatens 68 percent of the territory, while landslides endanger 55 percent of the area in seismic zones III and IV, which fall under the earthquake-prone belt and sub-Himalayan region, as well as the Western Ghat and North, North-East states. Flood and river erosion threaten over 40 million hectares (12 percent of land).In the event of a disaster, the responsible state government bears the primary responsibility for rescue, relief, and rehabilitation efforts. In the event of major natural calamities, the Central Government supplements the efforts of the state governments by giving logistical and financial help. Through the SDRF, the central government also provides financial help for both emergency rescue and relief as well as long-term team recovery.",
